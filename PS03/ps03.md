# Problem I

Find the general solution to the following ODE:

$$
y^{\prime \prime}
-
144y
=
0
$$ (1.0)

Following Kreyzsig's convention,
the given ODE can be rewritten as
$y^{\prime \prime} + \alpha y^{\prime} + \beta y = 0$
where
$\alpha = 0$
and
$\beta = -144$.
The characteristic equation (in $\lambda$) is then

$$
\lambda^{2} + \alpha \lambda + \beta = 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lambda^{2} - 144 = 0
$$ (1.1)
whose roots are
$\lambda_1 = + 12$
and
$\lambda_2 = - 12$.
This means that there are two basis functions
comprising the general solution,
*i.e.*,
$e^{12x}$
and
$e^{-12x}$.
Hence, the general solution to (1.0) is

$$
y = C_1 e^{12x} + C_2 e^{-12x}
$$ (1.2)
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.

# Problem II

Find the general solution to the following ODE:

$$
4 y^{\prime \prime}
-
20 y^{\prime}
+
25 y
=
0
$$ (2.0)

Dividing both sides of (2.0) by 4,
we get the equivalent standard form
(at least, according to Kreyzsig's convention)

$$
y^{\prime \prime}
-
5 y^{\prime}
+
\frac{25}{4} y
=
0
$$ (2.1)
where
$\alpha = -5$
and
$\beta = \frac{25}{4}$.
Then, the characteristic equation (in $\lambda$) is

$$
\lambda^{2} + \alpha \lambda + \beta = 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lambda^2 -5 \lambda + \frac{25}{4} = 0
$$ (2.2)

Notice that (2.2) is a perfect square binomial:

$$
\lambda^{2}
-
2 \left(\frac{5}{2}\right) y
+
\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}
=
0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\left(\lambda - \frac{5}{2}\right) = 0
$$
In other words,
the charateristic equation
has a real root of 2.5
with multiplicity of 2.
This means that the general solution
has two basis functions:
$e^{2.5x}$
and
$x e^{2.5x}$.
Hence, the general solution to (2.0) is

$$
y
=
\left(C_1 + C_2 x\right)
e^{2.5x}
$$ (2.3)
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.

# Problem III

$$
y^{\prime \prime}

=
0,
\quad
y \left(0\right) = 2,
\quad
y^{\prime} \left(0\right) = -5
$$ (3.0)

$$
\left(D^{2} -6D + 13I\right) y = 0
$$ (4.0)

# Problem V

Find the particular solution to the following DE:

$$
x^2 y^{\prime \prime}
-
4 x y^{\prime}
+
6 y
=
0,
\quad
y \left(1\right) = 1,
\quad
y^{\prime} \left(1\right) = 0
$$ (5.0)

# Problem VI

$$

4x - 3 e^{x}
$$ (6.0)

Method of Variation of Parameters:
