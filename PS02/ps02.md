# Problem 1

Solve the following ODE:

$$
\left(x^2y + y^3 - y\right) dx
+
\left(x^3 + xy^2 - x\right) dy
=
0
$$ (1.0)

Factoring and dividing both sides of (1.0) by
$x^2 + y^2$,

$$
\frac{
    \left[\left(x^2 + y^2\right) y - y\right]
}{x^2 + y^2}
dx
+
\frac{
    \left[\left(x^2 + y^2\right) x + x\right]
}{x^2 + y^2}
dy
=
0
$$

which simplifies to

$$
ydx + xdy
+
\frac{xdy - ydx}{x^2 + y^2}
=
0
$$ (1.1)

Observe that
the full differential of
$xy$ 
is given by

$$
d \left(xy\right)
=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\left(xy\right)
dx
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
\left(xy\right)
dy
=
ydx + xdy
$$ (1.2)

In the same manner,
the full differential of
$\arctan \frac{y}{x}$
is given by

$$
d \left(\arctan \frac{y}{x}\right)
=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\left(\arctan \frac{y}{x}\right)
dx
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
\left(\arctan \frac{y}{x}\right)
dy
=
\frac{- ydx + xdy}{x^2 + y^2}
$$ (1.3)

In other words,
the given ODE is equivalent to

$$
d \left(xy\right)
+
d \left(\arctan \frac{y}{x}\right)
=
0
$$ (1.4)

Integrating both sides of (1.4)

$$
\int d \left(xy\right)
+
\int d \left(\arctan \frac{y}{x}\right)
=
\int 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
xy + \arctan \frac{y}{x} + C = 0
$$
where
$C$ collectively denotates the constants of integration.
With some abuse of notation,
the solution to (1.0) is

$$
xy + \arctan \frac{y}{x} = C
$$ (1.5)

where $C$ is a constant.

# Problem 2

Solve the following ODE:

$$
y dx + x dy + y^2 dy = 0
$$ (2.0)

Basic algebraic manipulation of (2.0) yields

$$
y dx
+
\left(x + y^2\right) dy
=
0
$$ (2.1)

Assume that (2.1) describes the
full differential of a function
$u \left(x,y\right) = C$,
where $C$ is some constant.
As such,
we can say that

$$
u \left(x,y\right) = C
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} dx
+
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} dy
=
0
$$

which, when compared to (2.1), yields

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = y
$$ (2.2a)

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = x + y^2
$$ (2.2b)

Differentiating (2.2a) with respect to $y$
and (2.2b) with respect to $x$
will show that (2.0) is an exact ODE:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)
= 1 =
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)
$$

This means that $u \left(x,y\right)$ is given by

$$
u \left(x,y\right)
=
\int \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} dx
+
K \left(y\right)
$$ (2.3)

where $K \left(y\right)$
is some function of $y$.
Substituting (2.2a) onto (2.3),

$$
u \left(x,y\right)
=
\int y dx
+
K \left(y\right)
=
xy + K \left(y\right)
$$ (2.4)

Differentiating both sides of (2.4)
with respect to $y$
and invoking (2.2b),

$$
\frac{\partial u \left(x,y\right)}{\partial y}
=
x
+
\frac{\partial K \left(y\right)}{\partial y}
=
x + y^2
$$

which gives

$$
\frac{\partial K \left(y\right)}{\partial y}
=
\frac{dK}{dy}
=
y^2
$$ (2.5)

Notice that (2.5) is a separable ODE,
*i.e.*

$$
dK = y^2 dy
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\int dK = \int y^2 dy
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
K \left(y\right)
=
\frac{1}{3} y^3 + \tilde{C}
$$ (2.6)

where $\tilde{C}$
is a constant of integration.
Substituting (2.6) onto (2.4),

$$
xy + \frac{1}{3} y^3 + \tilde{C} = C
$$

or, with some simplification
and abuse of notation,
the solution to (2.0) is

$$
3xy + y^3 = C
$$ (2.7)
