# ES 202 Problem Sets

A repository of worked problem sets given during the ES 202 course handled by Shahani T. Lagura.

## Directory

There are five (5) problem sets located in dedicated directories:

- Problem Set 1 is in [`PS01/`]("./PS01/").
- Problem Set 2 is in [`PS02/`]("./PS02/").
- Problem Set 3 is in [`PS03/`]("./PS03/").
- Problem Set 4 is in [`PS04/`]("./PS04/").
- Problem Set 5 is in [`PS05/`]("./PS05/").

## Code

Problem Sets 4 and 5 have accompanying Python scripts written just for fun.
For reproducibility, you may instantiate a Conda environment using the YML file `misc/es-202.yml`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/christian-cahig/ES202.git  # Clone this repository
cd ES202                                                # Navigate to repository folder
conda env create --file misc/es-202.yml                 # Create Conda environment
```

This will create a Conda environment named `es-202` which can be activated by invoking

```shell
conda activate es-202
```
