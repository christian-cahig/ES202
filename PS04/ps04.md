# Problem I

Find the solution to the following differential equation:

$$
\left(
D^{3} - D
\right)
y
=
4 e^{-x} + 3 e^{2x}
$$ (1.0)

Neglecting the right-hand side of (1.0)
gives a homogeneous ODE
whose characteristic equation (in $\lambda$) is
$\lambda^{3} - \lambda = 0$&mdash;that is,
the characteristic roots are
$-1,0,1$.
Hence, the homogeneous solution is the superposition of basis functions
$e^{-x}$, $e^{0x}$, and $e^{x}$:

$$
y_{\textsf{h}}
=
C_{1} e^{-x} + C_{2} e^{0x} + C_{3} e^{x}
=
C_{1} e^{-x} + C_{2} + C_{3} e^{x}
$$ (1.1)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are constants.

Inspecting the right-hand side of (1.0),
we can deduce that
$e^{-x}$ and $e^{2x}$
also are basis functions for the general solution.
However, $e^{-x}$ is already "subscribed" to $y_{\textsf{h}}$,
and must therefore be treated as a "repeating" basis.
The particular solution is then the superposition of basis functions
$x e^{-x}$ and $e^{2x}$:

$$
y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{4} x e^{-x}
+
C_{5} e^{2x}
$$
where $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$ are constants.
Differentiating $y_{\textsf{p}}$
successively with respect to $x$,

$$
D y_{\textsf{p}} = y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime}
=
C_{4} e^{-x} - C_{4} x e^{-x} + 2 C_{5} e^{2x}
$$
$$
D^{3} y_{\textsf{p}} = y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime \prime \prime}
=
3 C_{4} e^{-x} - C_{4} x e^{-x} + 8 C_{5} e^{2x}
$$
and substituting onto (1.0) will eventually give

$$
2 C_{4} e^{-x} + 6 C_{5} e^{2x}
=
4 e^{-x} + 3 e^{2x}
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
C_{4} = 2, \quad C_{5} = 0.5
$$
Hence, the particular solution is

$$
y_{\textsf{p}} = 2 x e^{-x} + 0.5 e^{2x}
$$ (1.2)

Therefore, the general solution to (1.0)
is the superposition of
$y_{\textsf{h}}$ and $y_{\textsf{p}}$:

$$
y
=
y_{\textsf{h}} + y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{1} e^{-x} + C_{2} + C_{3} e^{x}
+
2 x e^{-x} + 0.5 e^{2x}
$$ (1.3)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are constants.

# Problem II

Find the solution to the following differential equation:

$$
\left(
D^{3} - 2 D^{2} + D
\right)
y
=
x
$$ (2.0)

Neglecting the right-hand side of (2.0)
gives a homogeneous ODE
whose characteristic equation (in $\lambda$) is
$\lambda^{3} - 2 \lambda^{2} + \lambda = 0$&mdash;that is,
the characteristic roots are
$0$ and $1$,
the latter having a multiplicity of two.
Hence, the homogeneous solution is the superposition of basis functions
$e^{0x}$, $e^{x}$, and $x e^{x}$:

$$
y_{\textsf{h}}
=
C_{1} e^{0x} + C_{2} e^{x} + C_{3} x e^{x}
=
C_{1} + C_{2} e^{x} + C_{3} x e^{x}
$$ (2.1)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are constants.

Inspecting the right-hand side of (2.0),
we can deduce that the particular solution is of the form
$C_{4} x + C_{5}$,
where $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$ are constants.
However, the constant function $C_{5}$ is already
"subscribed" to $y_{\textsf{h}}$,
and is essentially a "repeat" of the $C_{1}$ term.
The particular solution is then the superposition of basis functions
$x^{2}$ and $x$:

$$
y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{4} x^{2} + C_{5} x
$$
Differentiating $y_{\textsf{p}}$
successively with respect to $x$

$$
D y_{\textsf{p}} = y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime}
=
2 C_{4} x + C_{5}
$$
$$
D^{2} y_{\textsf{p}} = y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime \prime}
=
2 C_{4}
$$
$$
D^{3} y_{\textsf{p}} = y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime \prime \prime}
=
0
$$
and substituting onto (2.0) will eventually give

$$
2 C_{4} x + C_{5} - 4 C_{4} = x
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
C_{4} = 0.5, \quad C_{5} = 2
$$
Hence, the particular solution is

$$
y_{\textsf{p}} = 0.5 x^{2} + 2 x
$$ (2.2)

Therefore, the general solution to (2.0)
is the superposition of
$y_{\textsf{h}}$ and $y_{\textsf{p}}$:

$$
y
=
y_{\textsf{h}} + y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{1} + C_{2} e^{x} + C_{3} x e^{x}
+
0.5 x^{2} + 2 x
$$ (1.3)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are constants.

# Problem III

Find the solution to the following differential equation:

$$
\left(
D^{4} + 4 D^{2} + 4
\right)
y
=
- 20
$$ (3.0)

Neglecting the right-hand side of (3.0)
gives a homogeneous ODE whose characteristic equation
(in $\lambda$) is
$\lambda^{4} + 3 \lambda^{2} + 4 = 0$.
This corresponds to the complex conjugate roots
$\plusmn \sqrt{2} i$,
each having a multiplicity of two.
This means that the homogeneous solution is
the superposition of the basis functions
$\cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)$,
$\sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)$,
$x \cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)$,
and
$x \sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)$:

$$
y_{\textsf{h}} =
C_{1} \cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{2} \sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{3} x \cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{4} x \sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
$$ (3.1)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$, and $C_{4}$ are constants.

Inspecting the right-hand side of (3.0),
we can deduce that the particular solution
is a constant $C_{5}$.
Differentiating and substituting to (3.0)
will yield

$$
4 C_{5} = -20
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
C_{5} = -5
$$
Hence, the particular solution is

$$
y_{\textsf{p}} = - 5
$$ (3.2)

Therefore, the general solution to (3.0)
is the superposition of $y_{\textsf{h}}$ and $y_{\textsf{p}}$:

$$
y
=
y_{\textsf{h}} + y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{1} \cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{2} \sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{3} x \cos \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
+
C_{4} x \sin \left(\sqrt{2} x\right)
- 5
$$ (3.3)
where $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$, and $C_{4}$ are constants.

# Problem IV

A spring is such that
a 2-lb weight stretches it 6 in.
An impressed force of
$0.25 \sin \left(8t\right)$
(lb)
and
a resisting force numerically equal to
the velocity at any instant
are both acting on the spring.
The weight starts 3 in below equilibrium point
with an imparted upward velocity of
3 ft/s.
Find the equation of motion.

Let us first lay down some assumptions and conventions.
We take the spring to be always vertically oriented.
The upper end is fixed,
while the lower end is attached
to the 2-lb weight assumed to be in the form of a point mass $m$.
The instantaneous vertical motion of this mass
is what we seek to describe mathematically.
Let $y$ be the vertical position (in ft) of the mass,
where $y = 0$ corresponds to the equilibrium point
(*i.e.*, when the mass-spring system hangs freely).
We assume $y > 0$ when the mass is above the equilibrium point.

At any $y$, the mass experiences four forces all measured in lb:
the weight $F_{\textsf{m}} = mg = 2$
(where $g = 32.17$ ft/s$^{2}$
is the acceleration due to gravity),
the periodic driving force
$F_{\textsf{d}} = 0.25 \sin \left(8t\right)$,
the resisting force
$F_{\textsf{r}} = y^{\prime}$
(where $y^{\prime}$ is the first order time derivative of $y$),
and
the spring force
$F_{\textsf{s}} = k y$
(where $k = 4$ lb/ft is the spring constant).
Since we are setting the equilibrium point
at when the mass-spring system hangs freely,
and not when the spring alone hangs freely,
the effect of $F_{\textsf{m}}$
on the motion of the mass
can be sufficiently subscribed to $F_{\textsf{s}}$
(that is, we can neglect $F_{\textsf{m}}$).
By Newtonian steady-state mechanics,
the net effect of $F_{\textsf{d}}$, $F_{\textsf{r}}$, and $F_{\textsf{s}}$
corresponds to a proportional acceleration in the point mass:

$$
F_{\textsf{d}} - F_{\textsf{r}} - F_{\textsf{s}}
= m y^{\prime \prime}
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
0.25 \sin \left(8t\right) - y^{\prime} - k y
= m y^{\prime \prime};
\quad k = 4,\ m = \frac{2}{32.17}
$$ (4.0a)
In other words,
we now have a second-order non-homogeneous linear ODE
as an initial value problem:

$$
y^{\prime \prime} + \frac{1}{m} y^{\prime} + \frac{k}{m} y
= \frac{1}{4m} \sin \left(8t\right);
\quad y \left(0\right) = -3,\ y^{\prime}\left(0\right) = 3
$$ (4.0b)

Ignoring the right-hand side of (4.0b),
we arrive at a homogeneous ODE whose characteristic equation is
$\lambda^{2} + \frac{1}{m} \lambda + \frac{k}{m} = 0$.
By the quadratic formula, the characteristic roots are

$$
\lambda_{1} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m},
\quad
\lambda_{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m}
$$ (4.1a)
Notice that, from (4.0a), $4km < 1$;
ergo, $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ are real and distinct.
The homogeneous solution is the superposition of
the basis functions
$\exp \left(\lambda_{1} t\right)$
and
$\exp \left(\lambda_{2} t\right)$:

$$
y_{\textsf{h}}
=
C_{1} \exp \left(\lambda_{1} t\right)
+
C_{2} \exp \left(\lambda_{2} t\right)
$$ (4.1b)
where $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are constants.

Now, inspecting the right-hand side of (4.0b),
we can deduce that the particular solution
is a superposition of the basis functions
$\cos \left(8t\right)$
and
$\sin \left(8t\right)$:

$$
y_{\textsf{p}}
=
C_{3} \cos \left(8t\right)
+
C_{4} \sin \left(8t\right)
$$ (4.2a)
where $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$ are constants.
The velocity and acceleration
based on $y_{\textsf{p}}$ would be

$$
y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime}
=
8 C_{4} \cos \left(8t\right)
-
8 C_{3} \sin \left(8t\right),
\quad
y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime \prime}
=
-64 C_{3} \cos \left(8t\right)
-
64 C_{4} \sin \left(8t\right)
$$
Substituting
$y_{\textsf{p}}$,
$y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime}$,
and
$y_{\textsf{p}}^{\prime \prime}$
onto (4.0b),

$$
\left(
-64 C_{3} + \frac{k C_{3}}{m} + \frac{8 C_{4}}{m}
\right)
\cos \left(8t\right)
+
\left(
- \frac{8 C_{3}}{m} -64 C_{4} + \frac{k C_{4}}{m}
\right)
\sin \left(8t\right)
=
\frac{1}{4m}
\sin \left(8t\right)
$$
which gives

$$
C_{3} =
\frac{-8}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
};
\quad
C_{4} =
\frac{-64m + k}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
}
$$ (4.2b).

The complete solution to (4.0b)
is the superposition of
$y_{\textsf{h}}$ and $y_{\textsf{p}}$:

$$
y \left(t\right) =
C_{1} \exp \left(\lambda_{1} t\right)
+
C_{2} \exp \left(\lambda_{2} t\right)
+
C_{3} \cos \left(8t\right) + C_{4} \sin \left(8t\right)
$$ (4.3a)
where
$C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are yet unknown constants,
and

$$
\lambda_{1} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m},
\quad
\lambda_{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m}
$$ (4.3b)
$$
C_{3} =
\frac{-8}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
};
\quad
C_{4} =
\frac{-64m + k}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
}
$$ (4.3c)

The complete solution should meet the initial conditions.
Hence, for the initial position of the point mass,

$$
y \left(0\right)
=
C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{3}
=
-3
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
C_{1} + C_{2} = - C_{3} - 3
$$ (4.4a)
For the initial velocity of the point mass,

$$
y^{\prime} \left(0\right)
=
\lambda_{1} C_{1} + \lambda_{2} C_{2} + 8 C_{4}
=
3
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lambda_{1} C_{1} + \lambda_{2} C_{2} = -8 C_{4} + 3
$$ (4.4b)
Solving (4.4a) and (4.4b) for the unknowns,

$$
C_{1} =
\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{3}
-
\frac{8}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{4}
+
\frac{3 \left(1 + \lambda_{2}\right)}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}}
$$
$$
C_{2} =
\frac{- \lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{3}
+
\frac{8}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{4}
-
\frac{3 \left(1 + \lambda_{1}\right)}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}}
$$
As expected,
$\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$,
$C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$, and $C_{4}$,
are all dependent on system parameters $k$ and $m$.

Therefore, the complete solution to
(4.0b)&ndash;*i.e.*,
the equation of motion for the point mass&ndash;expressed
in terms of $k$ and $m$, is

$$
y \left(t\right) =
C_{1} \exp \left(\lambda_{1} t\right)
+
C_{2} \exp \left(\lambda_{2} t\right)
+
C_{3} \cos \left(8t\right) + C_{4} \sin \left(8t\right)
$$ (4.5a)
$$
\lambda_{1} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m},
\quad
\lambda_{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4km}}{2m}
$$ (4.5b)
$$
C_{3} =
\frac{-8}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
};
\quad
C_{4} =
\frac{-64m + k}{
256 + 4096 m^{2} - 128 mk + k^{2}
}
$$ (4.5c)
$$
C_{1} =
\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{3}
-
\frac{8}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{4}
+
\frac{3 \left(1 + \lambda_{2}\right)}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}};
\quad
C_{2} =
\frac{- \lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{3}
+
\frac{8}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}} C_{4}
-
\frac{3 \left(1 + \lambda_{1}\right)}{\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}}
$$ (4.5d)
Substituting $k = 4$, $m = \frac{2}{g}$, and $g = 32.17$,
and rounding up floating-point terms to three decimal places,

$$
y \left(t\right) =
-19.339 \exp \left(-7.458 t\right)
+
16.370 \exp \left(-8.627 t\right)
-
0.031 \cos \left(8t\right)
+
8.257 \times 10^{-5} \sin \left(8t\right)
$$ (4.5e)
