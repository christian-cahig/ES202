$$
\left(
D^{4} + 4 D^{2} + 4
\right)
y
=
- 20
$$ (3.0)

# Problem IV

A spring is such that
a 2-lb weight stretches it 6 in.
An impressed force of
$0.25 \sin 8t$
(lb)
and
a resisting force numerically equal to
the velocity at any instant
are both acting on the spring.
The weight starts 3 in below equilibrium point
with an imparted upward velocity of
3 ft/s.
Find the equation of motion.

# Problem V

A coil of inductance 1 henry
and negligible resistance
is connected in series with
a capacitance of $10^{-6}$ farads
and
an EMF of $E$ volts.
Taking $Q = I = 0$ at time $t = 0$,
find the charge $Q$
and the current $I$
when $t = 0.001$ s
if
(a) $E = 100$ volts;
(b) $E = 100 \sin 500t$ volts;
and
(c) $E = 100 \sin 1000t$ volts.
