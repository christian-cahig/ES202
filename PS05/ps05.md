## Problem I

Find the power series solution (in $x$) of the following ODE:

$$
y^{\prime \prime} + 2 x y^{\prime} + y = 0
$$ (1.0)

We assume that the solution $y$ is a power series solution:

$$
y = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} a_{m} x^{m}
$$ (1.1)
where the $a_{n}$ terms are constant coefficients.
Differentiating $y$ with respect to $x$,

$$
y^{\prime} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} m a_{m} x^{m-1}
\\
y^{\prime \prime} = \sum_{m=2}^{\infty} m \left(m - 1\right) a_{m} x^{m-2}
$$ (1.2)
Substituting (1.2) onto (1.0),

$$
\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} m \left(m - 1\right) a_{m} x^{m-2}
+
2 \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} m a_{m} x^{m}
+
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} a_{m} x^{m}
= 0
$$
The first series can be re-written
in terms of $x^{m}$, *i.e.*,

$$
\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} m \left(m - 1\right) a_{m} x^{m-2}
=
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \left(m + 2\right) \left(m + 1\right) a_{m+2} x^{m}
$$
Moreover, notice that the index of second series in (1.3) can start at $m = 0$:

$$
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} m a_{m} x^{m}
=
0 \cdot a_{0} x^{0} + 1 \cdot a_{1} x^{1} + 2 \cdot a_{2} x^{2} + \cdots
=
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} m a_{m} x^{m}
$$
The series equivalent of the given ODE can now be expressed
in terms of $x^{m}$ and with indices starting at 0:

$$
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}
\left[\left(m + 2\right) \left(m + 1\right) a_{m+2} + \left(2m + 1\right) a_{m}\right]
x^{m} =0
$$ (1.3)
The homogeneity of the given ODE means that the corresponding coefficient
of $x^{m}$ in (1.3) is zero, that is,

$$
a_{m+2} = -
\frac{2m + 1}{\left(m + 1\right) \left(m + 2\right)}
a_{m}
$$ (1.4)
Note that $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ cannot be determined from the recurrence relation alone,
and hence in the present treatment will be as arbitrary constants
derived from additional information (*e.g.*, initial conditions).
Therefore, we can write the series solution to (1.0) as

$$
y = a_{0} + a_{1} x -
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{2m + 1}{\left(m + 1\right) \left(m + 2\right)} x^{m+2}
$$ (1.5)
where $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ are constants.

## Problem II

Find the power series solution (in $x$) of the following ODE:

$$
y^{\prime \prime} - 4 x y^{\prime} + \left(4 x^{2} - 2\right) y = 0
$$ (2.0)

## Problem III

Find a basis of solutions for the following ODE.
Try to identify the series as expansions of known functions.

$$
2 x y^{\prime \prime} + \left(3 - 4x\right) y^{\prime} + \left(2x - 3\right) y = 0
$$ (3.0)

## Problem IV

Find a basis of solutions for the following ODE.
Try to identify the series as expansions of known functions.

$$
x^{2} y^{\prime \prime} + 2 x^{3} y^{\prime} + \left(x^{2} - 2\right) y = 0
$$ (4.0)

## Problem V

Find the general solution
(in terms of $J_{\textsf{v}}$ and $Y_{\textsf{v}}$)
to the following ODE
by using $12 \sqrt{x} = z$:

$$
x y^{\prime \prime} + y^{\prime} + 36y = 0
$$
